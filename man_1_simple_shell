       simple-shell - A simple re-creation of Unix shell.

.SH SYNOPSIS
       simple-shell

       #Include "shell.h"

.SH DESCRIPTION
       The simple-shell command launches a basic Unix shell that allows users to interact with
       their operating system through a command-line interface. It supports executing commands,
       running scripts, and basic shell operations.

.SH OPTIONS
       To use this shell you have to compile doing and running the program doing :   
       
       $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh

       $ ./hsh

.SH COMMANDS
      
     
      The simple-shell supports various commands :
   
      $ ls

      $ /bin/ls -l
      
      $ ls -a

      $ pwd
 
      $ echo 


       
    Execute the specified command and exit.

    exit: Exit the shell.
.SH SCRIPTS
       The simple-shell can also run shell scripts. A shell script is a file containing a series
       of shell commands that are executed in sequence. To run a script, simply pass its file name
       as an argument to the simple-shell command.

       Note that the script should have the appropriate execute permissions for the user running
       the simple-shell command.
